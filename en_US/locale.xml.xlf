<h4>Upgrade</h4>

<p>If you are upgrading an existing installation of OJS, <a href="{$upgradeUrl}">click here</a> to proceed.</p>

<h4>Recommended system requirements</h4>

	<li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> >= 4.1 or <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> >= 9.1.5</li>

<p>OJS has currently only been tested on MySQL and PostgreSQL, although other database management systems supported by <a href="http://adodb.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">ADOdb</a> may work (in full or partially).
